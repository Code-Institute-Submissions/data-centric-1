<h1 align="center"> Yogic Recipes </h1>

I created a full-stack C.R.U.D website for people interested in knowing more about Yogic Recipes with Positive 
Pranic food. The site is responsive on all devices, easy to use, read, add, update, and delete recipes. This is 
the third milestone project that I have created for Code Institute with my newly acquired skills

## UX (User Experience)

### User stories

1. As a First time Visitor, I want the purpose of the website to be clear, the information easy to digest and locate, and the navigation easy to use. I would like to quickly locate the list of Positive Pranic foods and info where I can learn more about what type of food to eat that is Positive Pranic approved. 
2. As a First time Visitor, I would like to see that I can choose a category of recipes and only see the recipes for that specific category. Then I want to be able to click on each recipe to read the full recipe information without having to look through a jungle of other stuff in the way.  
3. As a First time Visitor, I want to be able to locate the full recipe easily and only see the recipe information which is sufficient with clear text and not much else that is unnecessary and distracting. 
4. As a First time Visitor, I want to quickly be able to find a recipe by using the search input. 
5. As a First time Visitor, I want to figure out how to add a recipe and do it without complication, the form should be straightforward and intuitive. There should be validation, selection, and character limits to know what type of input is okay. 
6. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to find out without effort how to Edit and similarly update a recipe like I Added a recipe, with all the current recipe information displayed in the form. 
7. As a Returning Visitor, I want to, without looking too long, find out how to Delete a recipe with clear steps and be asked two times before the recipe gets deleted. 
8. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the owner of the website for any questions that I might have. I would also like to see if there are any social links so I can follow on social media.

### Design

The design for this website was made to be beautiful, simple, intuitive, and clear. Nice color and artistic recipe images are chosen to enhance the aesthetics of the page and bring up an appetite. The text on the page is made clear with only the most essential, desired, and straightforward info for the user.

#### Color Scheme
The website is quite colorful and consistency is kept with the colors with suiting color combinations. The main colors are green and orange/red. 
- The colors on the start page are chosen to match the colors in the hero-image, especially in the food list headings where there are three different background colors after each other like the three main colors on the recipe food hero-image. 
- On the rest of the pages, there is a green and red linear-gradient background-color, where there are green icons, a green SVG tree image, buttons in various shades that are shown in the navbar. The coloring in the recipe cards is similar to different shades of green on the icon and orange/red background color in the footer of the cards. The text throughout the website is dark green. 
- The colors on the buttons are different from each other for clear distinction with good contrasting and bright colors to make them stand out more. 

#### Typography
The default Materialize font is chosen for the whole page because I think it’s an elegant and clean font. It makes nice headings with its thick font weights which helps the page look more stylish and at the same time easy to read. 

#### Images 
- The hero image on the Start page was chosen after much thought for beautifying the page and taking the attention of the user by zooming in the image smoothly with an animation. The image, that contains a dish with food, has strong and bright colors that lift up the page and makes the food look more delicious and fresher.
- The SVG image of a green tree that is displayed on the rest of the pages in the navbar is chosen for it’s a beautiful and simple look that just makes you feel good looking at it, and it lifts up the green background of the pages and makes a good compliment to the other green icons of fruits and leaves. 
- The recipe images are beautiful and appetizing, nicely contrasting with the other colors on the page. 

#### Text   
The main text is divided into two short parts to make the reading easier, only the most important text is displayed to *not overload the reader with too much text*. 
Right below there is a clear and clean table of lists with Positive Pranic foods. Headings, buttons, and forms are decorated with icons for enhancing the UX and making the page look more beautiful.
