<h1 align="center"> Yogic Recipes </h1>

I created a full-stack C.R.U.D website for people interested in knowing more about Yogic Recipes with Positive 
Pranic food. The site is responsive on all devices, easy to use, read, add, update, and delete recipes. This is 
the third milestone project that I have created for Code Institute with my newly acquired skills

## UX (User Experience)

### User stories

1. As a First time Visitor, I want the purpose of the website to be clear, the information easy to digest and locate, and the navigation easy to use. I would like to quickly locate the list of Positive Pranic foods and info where I can learn more about what type of food to eat that is Positive Pranic approved. 
2. As a First time Visitor, I would like to see that I can choose a category of recipes and only see the recipes for that specific category. Then I want to be able to click on each recipe to read the full recipe information without having to look through a jungle of other stuff in the way.  
3. As a First time Visitor, I want to be able to locate the full recipe easily and only see the recipe information which is sufficient with clear text and not much else that is unnecessary and distracting. 
4. As a First time Visitor, I want to quickly be able to find a recipe by using the search input. 
5. As a First time Visitor, I want to figure out how to add a recipe and do it without complication, the form should be straightforward and intuitive. There should be validation, selection, and character limits to know what type of input is okay. 
6. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to find out without effort how to Edit and similarly update a recipe like I Added a recipe, with all the current recipe information displayed in the form. 
7. As a Returning Visitor, I want to, without looking too long, find out how to Delete a recipe with clear steps and be asked two times before the recipe gets deleted. 
8. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the owner of the website for any questions that I might have. I would also like to see if there are any social links so I can follow on social media.
