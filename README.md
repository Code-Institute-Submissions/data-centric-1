<h1 align="center"> Yogic Recipes </h1>

I created a full-stack C.R.U.D website for people interested in knowing more about Yogic Recipes with Positive 
Pranic food. The site is responsive on all devices, easy to use, read, add, update, and delete recipes. This is 
the third milestone project that I have created for Code Institute with my newly acquired skills

## UX (User Experience)

### User stories

1. As a First time Visitor, I want the purpose of the website to be clear, the information easy to digest and locate, and the navigation easy to use. I would like to quickly locate the list of Positive Pranic foods and info where I can learn more about what type of food to eat that is Positive Pranic approved. 
2. As a First time Visitor, I would like to see that I can choose a category of recipes and only see the recipes for that specific category. Then I want to be able to click on each recipe to read the full recipe information without having to look through a jungle of other stuff in the way.  
3. As a First time Visitor, I want to be able to locate the full recipe easily and only see the recipe information which is sufficient with clear text and not much else that is unnecessary and distracting. 
4. As a First time Visitor, I want to quickly be able to find a recipe by using the search input. 
5. As a First time Visitor, I want to figure out how to add a recipe and do it without complication, the form should be straightforward and intuitive. There should be validation, selection, and character limits to know what type of input is okay. 
6. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to find out without effort how to Edit and similarly update a recipe like I Added a recipe, with all the current recipe information displayed in the form. 
7. As a Returning Visitor, I want to, without looking too long, find out how to Delete a recipe with clear steps and be asked two times before the recipe gets deleted. 
8. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the owner of the website for any questions that I might have. I would also like to see if there are any links for social media that I can follow.

### Design

The design for this website was made to be beautiful, simple, intuitive, and clear. Nice color and artistic recipe images are chosen to enhance the aesthetics of the page and bring up an appetite. The text on the page is made clear with only the most essential, desired, and straightforward info for the user.

#### Color Scheme
The website is quite colorful and consistency is kept with the colors with suiting color combinations. The main colors are green and orange/red. 
- The colors on the start page are chosen to match the colors in the hero-image, especially in the food list headings where there are three different background colors after each other like the three main colors on the recipe food hero-image. 
- On the other pages, there is a green and red linear-gradient background-color, where there are green icons, a green SVG tree image, buttons in various shades of green placed in the navbar. The colors in the recipe cards are similar and contain icons with different shades of green and orange/red background color on the footer of the cards. The text throughout the website is dark green.
- The colors on the buttons are different from each other for clear distinction with good contrasting and bright colors to make them stand out more. 

#### Typography
The default Materialize font is chosen for the whole page because I think it’s an elegant and clean font. It makes nice headings with its thick font weights which helps the page look more stylish and at the same time easy to read. 

#### Images 
- The hero image on the Start page was chosen after much thought for beautifying the page and taking the attention of the user by zooming in the image smoothly with an animation. The image, that contains a dish with food, has strong and bright colors that lift up the page and makes the food look more delicious and fresher.
- The SVG image of a green tree that is displayed on the rest of the pages in the navbar is chosen for it’s a beautiful and simple look that just makes you feel good looking at it, and it lifts up the green background of the pages and makes a good compliment to the other green icons of fruits and leaves. 
- The recipe images are beautiful and appetizing, nicely contrasting with the other colors on the page. 

#### Text   
The main text is divided into two short parts to make the reading easier, only the most important text is displayed to *not overload the reader with too much text*. 
Right below there is a clear and clean table of lists with Positive Pranic foods. Headings, buttons, and forms are decorated with icons for enhancing the UX and making the page look more beautiful.

## Testing
### Testing User stories from UX section:
1.   **As a First time Visitor, I want the purpose of the website to be clear, the information easy to digest and locate, and the navigation easy to use. I would like to quickly locate the list of Positive Pranic foods and info where I can learn more about what type of food to eat that is Positive Pranic approved.**
        - **a.**  Upon visiting the website the I see a large, bright colorful, and elegant hero-image of a fruity dish that is zooming gently in. On top of the hero-image, there is a box with text showing “Explore Positive Pranic Recipes” with a search input below. Above the image, there is a conventional simple navbar with the logo “Yogic Recipes” and the menu clearly visible. 
    
        - **b.**  The About section that comes right after the hero-image tells without a doubt what the page is about and what I can do on the page. There is also a link to another page with more info, when I click on it I am taken to that page. Scrolling down just a little bit, I see lists of Positive Pranic food, making it easy to understand quickly what foods are included in the Yogic diet. 
    
        - **c.** Scrolling down a little more, I see two videos with a short explanatory text below each video. One video is about why it is beneficial to eat Positive Pranic food, explained by a popular yogic called Sadhguru. The other video shows Positive Pranic recipes that are in video so that I can choose to watch or read the recipes for more clarity. 

2.   **As a First time Visitor, I would like to see that I can choose a category of recipes and only see the recipes for that specific category, which are clearly displayed. Then I want to be able to click on each recipe to read the full recipe information without having to look through a jungle of other stuff in the way, the recipes should be clearly lined out.**
        - **a.**  Upon entering the page, I see the navbar which is clear and has a dropdown to the right with the name “Recipes” where all the categories are displayed when clicking on it. 
    
        - **b.** When clicking on any of the category names in the dropdown in the navbar, I am taken to that category with its belonging recipes. The recipes are displayed in cards with a clean recipe image, recipe name, and recipe time. When hovering over the recipe image I see the image darkening indicating that it is a link and the same with the underlined recipe name that changes color when hovering over it.  
    
        - **c.**  On clicking either the recipe image or recipe name, I am taken to see the full recipe. If I wish to go back to the previous category there is a colourful large button above that takes me back to the recipe category when clicking on it. Next to the category button, there is also an All Recipes button which takes me to see all recipes in card format when clicking on it. 

3.   **As a First time Visitor, I want to be able to locate the full recipe easily and only see the recipe information which is sufficient with clear text and not much else that is unnecessary and distracting.**
        - **a.** By clicking the dropdown in the navbar I can click on any of the links that take me to see the recipes in card format where all recipes have a clickable recipe image and recipe name. I can also search for a recipe in the search input that is clearly visible on all pages to get the recipes in the card format by searching for the recipe name or recipe time. 
    
        - **b.** By clicking on the recipe name or recipe image in the recipe cards I am taken to see the full recipe information for only that single recipe. 
    
        - **c.** Upon entering the Recipe Detail page where the full recipe is shown, I see a simple and clear recipe with easy readability, and pleasant for the eyes with subtle stylish coloring. I see the same recipe image first and the same recipe name of the card I clicked, below is more information like portions, time, ingredients, and instructions put in a structured and tidy way. 

4.   **As a First time Visitor, I want to figure out how to add a recipe and do it without complication, the form should be straightforward and intuitive. There should be validation, selection, and character limits to know what type of input is okay.**
        - **a.** In the navbar, I see a link always visible with the name “Add Recipe”. When I click on the link, I am taken to the Add Recipe page where there is a form with labels and colorful icons explaining what information I should add in the inputs and select options. Scrolling down to the bottom of the form I see a large pink button with the name Add Recipe and a plus icon. When I click on the Add Recipe button without writing anything on the form, I see a text that shows up in the first input saying that this field must be filled out in order to submit the form. 
    
        - **b.** When I write the wrong input on any of the inputs in the form and select an invalid option, I see a red border color below, when I write the correct input and select a valid option then I see a green border below. On the input for Time in minutes, when I write anything other than numbers I get a red border underneath, only when I put in numbers I get a green border underneath. On the Your Name input when I write numbers I get a red border, and when I put letters the border gets green. On the Image input if I write anything less than 8 characters I get a red border.  When I only add one ingredient to the recipe I cannot submit the form, a text is showing up on the second ingredient input that is saying this field is required. On the select options, when clicking on the select option without choosing anything and just leaving it like it was on default, I get a red border color. When choosing any of the options in the select I get a green border. When trying to submit the form without writing anything in the Instruction inputs, I get a text showing up in the first Instruction input saying this field is required. 
    
        - **c.** Once submitting the form after all inputs and select options have a green border underneath, I am directed to the All Recipes page. A flash message there is saying “Recipe was Successfully Added”. On the All Recipes page where I currently was taken, I scroll down and I see that the new recipe I added is there. I click on the recipe name and I am taken to see the full recipe on the Recipe Detail page. I look at the whole recipe and I see that all the inputs I added are there, in the correct order and with the correct text. 

        - **d.**  For checking if there is any character limit on the Recipe Name, I press down a letter on the keyboard and I see that after a short while the characters are stopped in the input and I am prevented to add more characters. On the Time in minutes, I see that I can only write three numbers. I add a blank space with a number in the Time in minutes input to check if it is accepting a blank space and it does, a green border shows up.  

5.   **As a First time Visitor, I want to be able to find out without effort how to Edit and Update a recipe in a similar manner like I Added a recipe, with all the current recipe information displayed in the form.**
        - **a.**  When I am on the Recipe Detail page where the full recipe is shown, I see a large colorful button on the top right with the name “Edit Recipe” with an edit icon. When I click on it, I am taken to the “Edit Recipe” page and I see a heading with the name “Update Recipe”. The form and its content look the same as the form for the “Add Recipe”, with the current recipe information displayed in the inputs and select options.
        - **c.** I remove all text in the inputs and I click the Update Recipe button to see what happens, and a text shows up in the top input showing that this is a required field and I am prevented to submit the form. I write at least 8 characters in the Image input to see if it turns green and it does, on the Recipe Name input, I write only letters and I see a green border, on the Time in minutes input I write only numbers until the characters are 
            stopped, on the Ingredients I write something on the 1st input and the 2nd and I see a green border under. When I try to select "Choose Category" or "Choose Portions" on the select menus I am not able to, but I am able to select any other options within the select menu that are valid, and then a green border shows up. On the Instruction inputs, I write something in the second input and press the Update Recipe button and I am not able to sumbit the form, because I have not filled out the first Instruction input. When I write something in the first Instruction input I get a green border.
        - **d.** . After I change the text on the inputs and selections, and all are showing a green border, I click on the Update Recipe button. I am taken to the All Recipes page where a flash message is displaying “Recipe was Successfully Updated”. I scroll down and see that the recipe that I updated has a different recipe name, I click on the recipe name to see the full recipe and I see there that all the text I changed in the recipe is there and has replaced the previous information. 
6.	**As a Returning Visitor, I want to, without looking too long, find out how to Delete a recipe with clear steps and be asked two times before the recipe gets deleted.  I want to also find where I can cancel from doing any changes to the recipe.**

    - **a.** When I am on the Edit Recipe page where I can edit and update the recipe, I see a large red button with the name “Delete Recipe”. When I click on it, a modal comes up with the heading “Are you sure you want to DELETE this recipe? There are two buttons with different colors and icons on the modal with the text, “No Cancel” and “Yes Delete”.
    
    - **b.**  When I click on the No Cancel button in the modal, the modal closes. When I click on the Delete Recipe button I am taken to the All Recipes page where a flash message is showing “Recipe was deleted Successfully”, I scroll down and I cant see the recipe I deleted anymore. 
    
    - **c.**   On the Edit Recipe page there is a large blue button with the name “Cancel” and an x icon. When I click on it, I am taken to the All Recipes page and I scroll down to see if the recipe I canceled and click to see the full recipe info, and then I see everything looks the same.   

7.	**As a Returning Visitor, I want to quickly be able to find a recipe by using the search input.**

    - **a.** On the Start page, I see a search button clearly lined out with two buttons on the side of the hero-image with an infobox above with the large text “Explore Positive Pranic Foods”. On all other pages, there is a search input always visible at the top in the navbar. 
    
    - **b.**  When pressing enter without writing anything in the search input I get a message saying I must write something in the input. Upon writing something in the search input that I know will not give any results when clicking on the search button or pressing enter, I am taken to the All Recipes page where a red text is displaying “No Results Found. When I click on the Reset button next to the search input, all recipes show up on the All Recipes page.

    - **c.**  When typing in the search input looking for either the recipe name or the recipe in minutes, all the recipes show up that has the same word in it that I searched with. The same happens when searching by number, all the recipes with the same time shows up. I try to search with both the minutes in time and the recipe name and I see that the matching results come up. For e.g, if I write "15 oats", all the recipe shows up that has the number 15 and the word "oats" in them. When I write a word or number that only one recipe has, then only that single recipe shows up and no others. 
8.	**As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the owner of the website for any questions that I might have.  I would also like to see if there are any social links for following on social media.**

    - **a.** At the bottom of each page, there is a clear footer with a Contact button, three social media icons, and copyright. When clicking on any of the social media icons I am taken to each respective social media page. 
    
    - **b.** On clicking the Contact button, a modal comes up displaying a simple form with Name input, Email, and Message area. When trying to submit the form with an incorrect name or email, a red text shows up under the inputs saying the inputs are not valid. When the inputs are valid, a green text shows up saying it's valid.  
    
    - **c.** When clicking the Send Message button, a loader comes up, and then shortly after, a message is displayed saying “Your message was Successfully sent”. When clicking the close button in the modal, the modal disappears and when opening the modal again the form is reset.

### Code

- Tim's Task Manager tutorial videos were used much as a reference for making my project, like setting up the Flask in my app.py file, 
    creating the env file, creating the search input code and C.R.U.D functionalities which I customized for my own project. 
- My mentor helped me improve the code I made for the categories on line 60 in the app.py file to avoid repetitive code.
- The code for the hero-image zooming in was taken from the Love Running project in the CI course. 
- The pattern for the email validation was taken from this [Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5601647/html5-email-input-pattern-attribute)
- For styling the scrollbar this [w3schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_custom_scrollbar.asp) was used and edited for my own needs.
- The code for making the loader was used from this [w3schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_loader.asp*/) and customized for my own needs. 
- I copied the validateMaterializeSelect() function from Tim's tutorial Task manager videos to make the validation work on the select options from Materialize.
- The ".then, function(response), return false" in the sendEmail() function was used from the Resume project on the CI course for getting a response when sending an email
and to prevent a new page from loading. 
### Content

The text on the start page is written by me. The text for the recipes are taken from here [Positive Pranic](https://positivepranic.com/) 
and here [10 Vegan Smoothies](https://mindfulavocado.com/vegan-smoothie-recipes/)
